'use strict'

/*
So to begin I need to work out several aspects. I will start with a character placeholder and work out the stat system and then begin work on the user character creator system.
After that comes the battle system.
Then how the user will travel. Do I make this all one page? Ideally I would want it that way but I currently don't have the skills to make that happen.  What to do... That will be a bridge I cross when I come to it. Either way user travel should be simple and intuitive. Buttons usually fill those requirements.

Limit global variables by calling them in local scopes, plan out simple and efficient functions.
