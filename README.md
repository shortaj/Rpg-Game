# Rpg-Game

This is my first real attempt at making a text-based adventure game in Javascript. As to what I am trying to accomplish with game, it is still in the air. As I am most familiar with basic rpg mechanics I will likely borrow probability mechanics and use similiar methodologies for combat. I will add more to the README as I work through the overall plan.
